Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. It generally involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a byproduct.

The process of photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. It can be summarized by the equation:

6CO‚ÇÇ + 6H‚ÇÇO + sunlight ‚Üí C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇO‚ÇÜ + 6O‚ÇÇ

This process is vital for the survival of most life forms on Earth. It provides the primary source of energy for nearly all ecosystems.

There are two main stages in photosynthesis: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin Cycle).

The light-dependent reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes and require sunlight. They produce ATP and NADPH, which are then used in the light-independent reactions.

The Calvin Cycle occurs in the stroma of the chloroplast and uses ATP and NADPH to convert CO‚ÇÇ into glucose.
