Q: What is photosynthesis?
A: It is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize food from carbon dioxide and water.

Q: What is the primary pigment involved in photosynthesis?
A: Chlorophyll.

Q: What are the main inputs and outputs of photosynthesis?
A: Inputs are carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight; outputs are glucose and oxygen.

Q: Where in the plant cell does photosynthesis occur?
A: In the chloroplasts.

Q: What is the overall equation of photosynthesis?
A: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + sunlight → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

Q: Why is photosynthesis vital for life on Earth?
A: It provides the primary source of energy for nearly all ecosystems.

Q: What are the two main stages of photosynthesis?
A: Light-dependent reactions and the Calvin Cycle (light-independent reactions).

Q: Where do light-dependent reactions occur?
A: In the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.

Q: What do light-dependent reactions produce?
A: ATP and NADPH.

Q: What is the function of the Calvin Cycle?
A: To use ATP and NADPH to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.

Q: Where does the Calvin Cycle take place?
A: In the stroma of the chloroplast.
